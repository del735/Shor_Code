# Nine-Qubit Shor Code
Implementation of the nine-qubit Shor quantum error correction code.

This program uses Qiskit to construct and execute quantum circuits.
Additionally, Qiskit-Aer is required to simulate quantum circuits and
retrieve the statevector with explicit state saving. LaTeX is needed to
represent mathematical expressions in circuits and Matplotlib figures.

## Required Dependencies
- **[Qiskit](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit)** - For building and running quantum circuits.
- **[Qiskit-Aer](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-aer)** - For statevector simulation and measurement processing.
- **[Matplotlib](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib)** - For visualizing circuits and statevectors.
## Further Requirement
- **LaTeX** - Needed for rendering mathematical expressions.
## Usage
Execute `run.py` to start the program.

In `nine_qubit_code_v2.py` (or `nine_qubit_code_v1.py`, depending on use),
edit `self.quantumCircuit.z(self.dataQubits[0])` in the `error()` function
to modify the location and type of error. The Shor code corrects single-qubit
$X, Y$, and $Z$ errors. The `dataQubits` indices range from 0 to 8, corresponding
to data qubits $q_0$ to $q_8$, respectively.

Note that single-qubit $Y$ errors introduce a global phase ($i$ or $-i$). Since global
phases do not affect measurement probabilities, the logical information is
still recovered as intended.

To change the input $q_0$, which is set to $|1\rangle$ by default, modify
`self.quantumCircuit.x(self.dataQubits[0])` in the `__init__` method. The decoded
qubit $q_0$ will match its input despite single-qubit error. Measurement behavior 
remains consistent as well.
