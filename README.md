# Nine-Qubit Shor Code
Implementation of the nine-qubit Shor quantum error correction code.

This program uses Qiskit to construct and execute quantum circuits.
Additionally, Qiskit-Aer is required to simulate quantum circuits and
retrieve the statevector with explicit state saving. LaTeX is needed to
represent mathematical expressions in circuits and Matplotlib figures.

## Required Dependencies
- **Qiskit** - For building and running quantum circuits.
- **Qiskit-Aer** - For statevector simulation and measurement processing.
- **Matplotlib** - For visualizing circuits and statevectors.
## Further Requirement
- **LaTeX** - Needed for rendering mathematical expressions.
